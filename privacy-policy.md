## **What information is stored?**

Only message content is stored.

## Why it is stored?
We store only _**message content**_ for the `!oculusname` and `!timezone` commands, which is used to save your oculus username and a server's main timezone.
Your oculus username is stored for the convenience of not having to search for your own stats.
Timezone is stored to viewing upcoming VRML matches more convenient for those who are not located in the EST/EDT timezone.

## How it is stored?
Data is stored in a local database.

## Who can see my data?
As the sole developer I am the only one with access to the database.
By saving your oculus username, you can use the `!stats` command without giving your own username, and as such it is easy to infer what username you have stored, but there is no lookup feature.

## How can I delete my Data?
If you wish to delete your stored username, simply use `!oculusname clear` to remove your stored name.
If you wish to delete your stored timezone, simply use `!timezone clear` to reset to the default (EST/EDT) timezone.
